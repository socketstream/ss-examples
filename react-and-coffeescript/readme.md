`nodemon app.js -e "js coffee"`

I'm using this for SocketStream development also, so you may not see the SocketStream dependency in the package.json file.

#### SocketStream, CoffeeScript and React demo

###### status (early development: started **May 4, 2015**)

###### Please note:
_(This demo uses a style React+CoffeeScript I learned from Alberto Torres Ruiz. This is not the only way of using React + CoffeeScript with SocketStream -- I or others may document other ways in the future. This is a nice way of doing it though.)_

##### todo:

- make a real chat demo app here

- write a webpack bundler for nirvana require for the libs
